### About me

Hi, my name is **Dimitri De Franciscis**

I'm a freelance Full Stack Developer, Digital Creative, Lifelong Learner.

I work on **digital projects** for SMEs, startups and global clients, **remotely** or **on-site**. I build applications that range from web sites to backend services, applying industry best practices with focus on **quality** and **maintainability**.

I deal with the **full stack**, from system architecture to back- and front-end work.

Although I have many interests and deep expertise in some areas, I am not the [mythical person who can do everything, from writing assembly code to sweet-talking the banks](http://radar.oreilly.com/2014/04/full-stack-developers.html).

I work with passion, dedication and creativity. Below are some of the services I can provide to your team:

- **Backend** programming using **Java** and/or **NodeJS** platforms
- **Frontend (Web)** programming using a whole bunch of technologies, from old-fashioned HTML/CSS + jQuery to modern AngularJS and React frameworks (or whatever will come out next week)
- **Cloud Computing**, DevOps and Container Technology
- **Content Strategy**: blogging, articles, documentation
